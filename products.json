      "short_description": "Glide into your next run with the On Womens Cloudsurfer Next, a shoe designed to deliver an incredibly smooth, soft, and natural ride. As the successor to the popular Cloudsurfer, the \"Next\" iteration takes a significant leap forward in comfort and technology, making it the perfect choice for women seeking a pure, effortless running experience. Its groundbreaking feature is the CloudTec Phase technology. Unlike traditional cushioning, CloudTec Phase uses a series of interlocking Cloud pods that are designed using computer-generated geometry to create a seamless, wave-like motion. This allows the pods to collapse sequentially from heel-strike to toe-off, providing a uniquely soft landing and a smooth, propulsive transition that feels incredibly natural. There is no conventional Speedboard; the cushioning itself is engineered to guide your foot. The result is a run that feels fluid, quiet, and remarkably cushioned. The upper is made from a lightweight, engineered mesh that offers a breathable and adaptive fit. For the woman who wants to simply enjoy the feeling of running, the On Womens Cloudsurfer Next delivers a perfectly smooth and cloud-like experience with every step.",

The top layer compresses for a soft, plush landing, while the bottom layer provides a stable, cushioned platform, effectively doubling the impact protection. This innovative design is guided by a uniquely curved Speedboard?, nestled between the two foam layers, which promotes a smooth, effortless rolling motion from heel-strike to toe-off. The result is a feel that's impossibly soft and incredibly efficient, reducing fatigue. The upper is crafted from a lightweight, engineered mesh for a premium feel.

      "short_description": "Train harder, move faster, and feel lighter with the On Men's Cloud X Sneakers. Born from the idea that less is more, the Cloud X is designed for athletes who need a shoe that can keep up with the most demanding workouts. It's a versatile hybrid that bridges the gap between a high-performance running shoe and a stable, flexible training shoe. The secret lies in its construction: the CloudTec? pods are positioned directly under the metatarsals, putting the cushioning exactly where you need it for explosive movements. This is combined with a unique, hollow-core Speedboard? that is both lightweight and flexible, allowing for a full range of motion during agility drills, lunges, and sprints. The result is a shoe that feels incredibly close to the ground, providing exceptional stability and feedback for strength training, while still offering the soft, responsive cushioning needed for short runs and HIIT sessions. The upper is made from a highly breathable, single-layer mesh that wraps the foot for a secure, sock-like fit. For the athlete who demands versatility without compromise, the On Men's Cloud X is the ultimate training partner, ready to take on everything from the weight room to the treadmill.",
